# Executive Summary: Observability Governance Strategy

## Objective
To implement a unified observability governance strategy that enables operational excellence, reduces alert noise, improves incident response, and increases business insight through meaningful telemetry, standardized practices, and tool integration.

## Why It Matters
Modern enterprises depend on observability not just to monitor systems, but to understand service health, customer experience, and business impact. Fragmented tools, inconsistent practices, and alert fatigue reduce reliability and responsiveness.

## Strategic Components
- **Event Management Strategy**: Standardizes event classification, tagging, enrichment, routing, correlation, and suppression.
- **Alerting Standards**: Improves alert relevance and reduces fatigue through metadata, thresholds, and review cycles.
- **Dashboards & KPIs**: Aligns visualizations with roles, simplifies decision-making, and supports SLO-based service health.
- **Instrumentation & Business Observability**: Ensures telemetry captures flow stages and customer impact across applications.
- **Tooling Governance**: Provides structure for tool standardization, integration, and data ownership.

## Current Deliverables
‚úÖ Event Management Framework  
‚úÖ Position on informational events (Splunk ITSI & BigPanda)  
‚úÖ Governance documentation template (12-section model)

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Assess observability maturity across teams.
2. Identify priority systems for alignment (pilot candidates).
3. Engage stakeholders to socialize event strategy.
4. Finalize standards and publish documentation.

## Governance KPIs to Track
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)
- Alert-to-incident ratio
- Business KPI alignment
- Observability coverage (% of critical apps instrumented)
