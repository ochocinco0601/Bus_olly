| 0  | **Title – “Business Observability Preview”**    | • Welcome; today is an internal dry-run.<br>• Next week: 15-min slot with CIO + directs at their off-site — this is our rehearsal.                                                 | 0:00  | —                                           |
| 1  | **Objective & Agenda**                          | • Objective: align on story, confirm visuals, capture gaps.<br>• Agenda: Core Belief → System flow → Pilot artifacts → Exec ask → Feedback.<br>• Outcome: finalized deck + actions.| 0:30  | —                                           |
| 2  | **Core Belief Quote** (from *Why This System*)  | • Read quote: Ownership • Relevance • Responsibility must be explicitly taught.<br>• Frame everything you’ll show as evidence of that principle in practice.                       | 1:00  | —                                           |
| 3  | **People – Process – Tools** triangle           | • Complexity lives where roles, workflows, tooling intersect.<br>• Business Observability is the synchronizing engine.                                                            | 2:00  | **2.2 Identify stages & steps**             |
| 4  | **Tactical Checklist with ✔ marks**             | • Full checklist screenshot; green ✔ show pilot progress for Capital-Markets step.<br>• Reinforce that this is repeatable and auditable.                                          | 3:00  | **1.1 Review checklist; 1.3 Choose pilot**  |
| 5  | **Template – BEFORE Validation**                | • Raw SME input: blanks, vague KPI text, no owners.<br>• Common starting point in workshops.                                                                                      | 4:00  | **3.1 Use GenAI template prompt**           |
| 6  | **Template – AFTER Validation** (highlights)    | • Validation prompt filled gaps in <2 min; yellow cells show improvements.<br>• Saves hours vs manual iterations.                                                                 | 5:00  | **3.4 Template Validation**                 |

| 11 | **Why It Matters ($ / Risk)**                   | • Example: 1-second routing delay ≈ **$25 K/day** lost spread.<br>• Observability alerts trigger remediation before value leaks.                                                   | 10:00 | **5.2 Why-matters**                         |
