**Prompt:**

Please generate a full ASCII tree diagram for a Loan Origination process following Model #2. The diagram should have the following hierarchical structure:

1. **Business Outcome (Top Level):**  
   - Name: "Increased Successful Loan Origination"  
   - Include a branch for Business Signals with example KPIs such as:  
     • Overall Origination Volume  
     • Conversion Rate  
     • Top-line Customer Satisfaction  

2. **Business Process (Next Level):**  
   - Name: "Loan Origination Process"

3. **Stages (Next Level, each with an Outcome):**  
   - Stage 1: "Customer Inquiry & Engagement"  
     - Outcome: "Enhanced lead capture"  
   - Stage 2: "Prequalification & Screening"  
     - Outcome: "Early filtering & risk profiling"  
   - Stage 3: "Application Intake & Documentation"  
     - Outcome: "Complete, accurate application capture"  
   - Stage 4: "Document Generation & Disclosure Delivery"  
     - Outcome: "Timely and accurate document delivery"  
   - Stage 5: "Initial Compliance & Data Verification"  
     - Outcome: "Verified compliance & validated data"  
   - Stage 6: "Application Review & Communication"  
     - Outcome: "Clear decision-making & defined next steps"

4. **Steps (Within each Stage, one step per stage):**  
   - For Stage 1, use: "Execute Marketing & Capture Inquiry"  
   - For Stage 2, use: "Perform Eligibility Check & Risk Profiling"  
   - For Stage 3, use: "Collect Application & Documents"  
   - For Stage 4, use: "Generate & Distribute Disclosure Documents"  
   - For Stage 5, use: "Conduct Compliance & Data Checks"  
   - For Stage 6, use: "Review Application & Communicate Decision"

5. **Signals for Each Step:**  
   - Each step should include a “Signals” branch divided into two parts:
     - **Business Signals:** Metrics that directly reflect business outcomes. For example:
       - For Stage 1: Lead Conversion Rate, Customer Engagement Rate  
       - For Stage 2: Prequalification Rate, Average Risk Score  
       - For Stage 3: Application Completion Rate  
       - For Stage 4: Disclosure Turnaround Time (≤3 business days), Delivery Compliance Rate, Document Accuracy Rate  
       - For Stage 5: Compliance Check Success Rate  
       - For Stage 6: Review Turnaround Time, Customer Notification Rate  
     - **Performance Reliability Signals:** Technical/operational metrics. For example:
       - For Stage 1: Inquiry Response Time, Marketing System Uptime  
       - For Stage 2: Screening Processing Time, Eligibility Check Accuracy  
       - For Stage 3: Document Submission Time, Intake Portal System Uptime  
       - For Stage 4: Rate of Document Generation, Latency of Document Generation, Error Rate of Document Generation, System Availability/Uptime  
       - For Stage 5: Data Validation Accuracy, Compliance Processing Time  
       - For Stage 6: Communication System Latency, Review Processing Time

Please produce the ASCII tree diagram using the above structure. 

After the diagram, include a detailed explanation guide that:
- Describes each hierarchical level (Business Outcome, Business Process, Stage, Step, Signals)
- Explains what each signal category represents (Business Signals vs. Performance Reliability Signals)
- Provides a brief rationale on how this structure supports transparency and decision-making in a technology-driven environment.

Ensure the output is self-contained and does not assume prior context. Thank you.
