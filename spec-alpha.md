**Business Observability System (BOS) Platform Spec**

**Purpose**
Provide a concise, 1–2 page internal specification for the BOS platform, outlining its layered architecture, user flows, key functional and non-functional requirements, and next steps.

---

## 1. Overview

The BOS platform transforms the current spreadsheet-and-email prototype into a scalable, user-friendly, and durable system of record. It will guide users through a factory-style workflow: Define → Populate → Validate → Dashboard → Feedback.

**Goals:**

* Replace manual templates with a web application
* Embed versioning, audit logs, and governance
* Integrate with telemetry, CI/CD, and collaboration tools

## 2. System Layers

| Layer                 | Responsibility                                                                                               | Technology Options                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Data Layer**        | Store templates, signals, ownership, audit logs                                                              | PostgreSQL (with JSONB), Elasticsearch |
| **API Layer**         | Expose CRUD, validation, versioning, search, and RBAC endpoints                                              | REST or GraphQL                        |
| **Application Layer** | Provide UI/UX flows (stepper wizard) for each BOS stage: Define → Populate → Validate → Dashboard → Feedback | React SPA                              |
| **Integration Layer** | Ingest system signals, publish to Jira/Confluence, send notifications                                        | Webhooks, SDKs                         |
| **Automation**        | CI/CD pipelines for observability-as-code checks, template linting, and deployment                           | GitOps, Jenkins/GitHub Actions         |

## 3. User Flows

1. **Define Business Flow**

   * User selects or creates a new business process
   * Completes metadata (name, description, owner)
2. **Populate Template**

   * Wizard guides input of `Process Signals`, `System Signals`, and `Value Outcomes`
   * Inline help and validation rules
3. **Validate Ownership**

   * System enforces that every field is assigned to a role
   * Approval workflows for critical fields
4. **Dashboard Generation**

   * One-click to generate a dashboard stub
   * Auto-populate with telemetry queries and KPI calculations
5. **Feedback & Iteration**

   * In-app feedback widget on each dashboard
   * Scheduled reviews (weekly pilot check-ins, PI retrospectives)

---

## 4. Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements

* **Template CRUD:** Create, read, update, delete business observability templates
* **Signal Management:** Define, tag, and relate process/system signals
* **Dashboard Stub:** Generate initial dashboards based on template inputs
* **Role-Based Access:** Assign and enforce editing/viewing rights per role
* **Audit Trail:** Track changes to templates and dashboards with user, timestamp, and rationale

### Non-Functional Requirements

* **Scalability:** Handle hundreds of flows and thousands of signal definitions
* **Performance:** Dashboard generation within 5 seconds
* **Durability:** Version history and rollback for all changes
* **Usability:** Intuitive wizard-style UI, contextual help, and training guides
* **Integration:** Connectors to Splunk, Grafana, AppDynamics, Jira, Confluence, Slack
* **Security & Compliance:** RBAC, SSO integration, data encryption at rest and in transit

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Review & Alignment:** Share spec with Observability CoE and Director for feedback
2. **MVP Vertical Slice:** Develop the end-to-end flow for one pilot process (e.g., Loan Payment Processing)
3. **Technology Selection:** Confirm technology stack and integration approaches
4. **Team Formation:** Assign roles for full-stack, UX, SRE, and integration engineers
5. **Pilot Kickoff:** Launch development sprint for MVP; schedule weekly demo & feedback sessions
