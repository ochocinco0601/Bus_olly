Headline (Gaining Real-Time Business Insights through Unified Observability): We are advancing our business observability initiative, laying the groundwork for a unified view of technology's impact on our bottom line.

 

Overview of Progress: Significant progress has been made in defining the core concepts and benefits of business observability. We are aligning our understanding of how system health relates to actual user-impacting business stages or "customer journeys". This includes identifying key components such as Flows, Stages, Steps, and Signals (Touchpoints), which will provide a structured approach to visualizing our critical business processes. We have also begun to explore the key functionalities, such as KPI tracking, historical analysis, and the integration of AI-driven insights. Initial discussions have involved understanding how to map our critical business stages and identify relevant KPIs to reflect business success.

 

Business Impact: Implementing a business observability solution has the potential to deliver significant business value. By linking technical performance to financial outcomes, we can expect to make more informed, data-driven decisions about software investments and resource allocation. This unified view will empower us to proactively identify and resolve issues impacting customer journeys, leading to improved customer experience and reduced churn. Furthermore, by understanding the financial impact of system issues, we can optimize resource allocation, minimize downtime impact, and ultimately drive increased ROI and revenue.

 

Next Steps / Looking Ahead: In the coming weeks, our focus will be on:

 


Developing a template for business and product teams to document their respective flows and customer journeys, including key stages, steps, and potential KPIs.


Conducting initial workshops to collaborate with product managers and software engineering leads to map critical customer journeys, such as the example of the Hipster Store application's journey from homepage visit to order confirmation.


Further exploring how to define clear objectives and assess our current state of IT environment and monitoring practices as foundational steps for implementation.
 

Request for Engagement / Support: To ensure the success of this initiative, we request the executive leadership team's support in championing this effort across departments. Your engagement in highlighting the strategic importance of business observability will be crucial in fostering cross-functional collaboration. We will require commitment from business and product teams to actively participate in the journey mapping exercises in the coming weeks. Your guidance on aligning our business observability metrics with overarching strategic objectives will also be invaluable.
