Using the framework for a problem statement, drawing on the sources, a business observability problem statement can be articulated as follows:

**1. Identify the Problem**

Organizations are facing difficulties in **comprehensively understanding the impact of technology performance on business outcomes**. This issue arises in complex IT environments characterized by cloud computing, microservices, and hybrid infrastructures. Traditional IT monitoring tools provide a fragmented view due to data silos, making it hard to correlate IT health with business results.

**2. Put the Problem into Context**

*   This problem leads to several critical costs:
    *   **Financial Costs**: Inability to optimize resource allocation, leading to increased operational costs and missed revenue opportunities.
    *   **Reputational Costs**: Poor customer experience due to unaddressed technology issues, potentially leading to customer churn.
    *   **Operational Costs**: Inefficient processes and reactive risk management, resulting in increased downtime and service disruptions.
*   The main issue is a symptom of a greater challenge:
    *   The **inability to connect technology investments with tangible business outcomes**.
*   Past solutions have not worked because:
    *   Traditional IT monitoring tools **lack the sophistication to correlate technical metrics with business KPIs**.
    *   Data silos prevent a holistic view of the relationship between IT service health and business results.
*   What we definitely know about the current problem:
    *   **Traditional IT monitoring is insufficient** for providing a comprehensive understanding of the impact of technology on business outcomes.
    *   **Data silos** are a significant impediment to gaining a holistic view of system performance.

**3. Find the Root Cause**

The root cause can be uncovered by asking "why" questions about the problem:

*   Why can't organizations understand the impact of technology on business outcomes? Because of the increasing **complexity of IT systems and the limitations of traditional IT monitoring approaches**.
*   Why are traditional IT monitoring approaches insufficient? Because they **focus on isolated technical metrics and fail to provide a holistic view of IT service health** in relation to business results.
*   Why do data silos exist? Because traditional IT monitoring relies on a **multitude of tools to collect data from various sources, leading to a fragmented view of system performance**.

**4. Describe Your Ideal Outcome**

The ideal outcome is that organizations can gain a **clear, real-time understanding of how technology impacts business outcomes**. This involves implementing a business observability solution that:

*   **Correlates technology performance with business metrics**.
*   **Provides a holistic view of IT service health** in relation to business results.
*   **Enables proactive risk management** by identifying and mitigating potential issues before they escalate.
*   **Drives data-driven innovation** by informing strategic decision-making with comprehensive insights.

**5. Propose a Solution and Outline Its Benefits**

The proposed solution is to implement **business observability**:

*   **Solution**: Implement a business observability platform that integrates data from various sources, correlates technology performance with business metrics, and provides a comprehensive view of IT service health in relation to business outcomes.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Improved Understanding of Technology's Impact on Revenue**: By correlating system performance data with business metrics, organizations can identify how technology issues impact revenue generation.
    *   **Enhanced Customer Experience**: By monitoring user interactions, application performance, and system health, businesses can identify and address issues that negatively impact customer experience.
    *   **Increased Operational Efficiency**: By providing insights into system performance, observability enables organizations to identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and streamline processes.
    *   **Proactive Risk Management**: By monitoring system health in real-time, organizations can identify and mitigate potential issues before they escalate into major problems.
    *   **Data-Driven Innovation**: By understanding how technology performs and impacts business outcomes, organizations can make informed decisions about investments in new technologies and infrastructure.
    *   **Process Understanding**: Through process intelligence, organizations gain insights into the "why" behind business performance, enabling optimization and proactive adjustments.
    *   **Cost Reduction and Improved Efficiency**: Organizations can lower costs and improve the speed and accuracy of insights by consolidating their observability tools into a single, unified platform.

Therefore, implementing business observability enables organizations to make informed decisions, optimize processes, and achieve their business goals by providing a comprehensive understanding of how IT service health relates to business results.
