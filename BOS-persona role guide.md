### Persona Role Guide (Fully Aligned with Template Ownership)

Each persona contributes to different parts of the business observability effort. This guide uses exact role labels that match the Unified Business Observability System template fields, ensuring consistency across all documentation layers.

| Persona (Exact Match)              | What You Own                                                                 | Why It Matters                                                                                   | Key Contributions                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Product Owner / Business SME      | `KPI` definitions, `business signals`, `step purpose`, internal and external `user goals` | You define business success, connect goals to observable outcomes, and provide real-world relevance.   | - Define `user goals` and `business value`<br>- Specify `KPI` targets<br>- Review `business signals` |
| Application Developer / Architect | `Technical function`, `process signals`, `input/output logic`, `telemetry instrumentation` | You ensure the system behavior is understandable, observable, and testable through telemetry.          | - Describe technical function and data flow<br>- Instrument key signals<br>- Define `process signals` |
| Platform SRE                      | `System signals`, system health, dashboard metrics, sometimes `observability facilitation` | You maintain system performance and reliability while ensuring observability is accurate and actionable | - Define and monitor `system signals`<br>- Validate alerts and thresholds<br>- Support dashboards |
| Platform SRE                      | `KPI` visibility, dashboard integration, cross-platform observability validation   | You ensure `KPI` definitions and metrics are valid, visible, and represent platform health across systems | - Translate telemetry into `KPI` views<br>- Assist with `dashboard` design<br>- Validate coverage |
| Observability Facilitator         | Artifact readiness, `signal â†’ owner` traceability, system adoption support         | You coordinate observability readiness and enforce completion and clarity across roles and artifacts   | - Drive template validation<br>- Enforce `signal ownership` alignment<br>- Lead onboarding readiness |

*Note: The Platform SRE role appears twice to reflect its dual responsibilities in both system reliability and KPI observability. This is intentional and aligns with actual team responsibilities.*
