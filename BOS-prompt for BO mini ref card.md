# Prompt: Draft Mini Reference Card

You are generating a Mini Reference Card for a specific step in a business process using an already validated Business Observability Template.

This card is a concise reference artifact. It summarizes **why the step matters**, who uses it, what success looks like (KPIs), how it’s monitored (signals), and what to do when things go wrong (alerts and actions).

---

## Instructions

- Use the completed Business Observability Template as input.
- Classify and structure content into the following sections:
  - **Why This Matters**
  - **Step Overview**
  - **Customer Goal**
  - **KPIs (with targets and ownership)**
  - **Signals (grouped by type and with owners)**
  - **Common Alerts**
  - **Responsibility Table (actions tied to thresholds/conditions)**

- If not already given, infer the `Step Type` (e.g., *Validation*, *Execution*, *Fulfillment*) based on:
  - Business Function / Purpose
  - Technical Function
  - KPI themes (e.g., data accuracy vs. transaction success)

Use that `Step Type` to inform:
- Signal emphasis
- Alert phrasing
- Suggested actions

---

### Step Type Examples

Use the `Step Type` to shape the tone and focus of the Mini Reference Card.

- **Validation Step**
  - Emphasize: correctness, completeness, data quality, compliance.
  - Signals: pass/fail checks, schema conformity, validation rates.
  - Alerts: failed validations, missing fields, integrity errors.
  - Example phrase: “Ensure all required loan fields are present and accurate before trade creation.”

- **Execution Step**
  - Emphasize: transaction success, speed, volume, business throughput.
  - Signals: success rates, latency, transaction count, efficiency.
  - Alerts: failures, delays, missed thresholds.
  - Example phrase: “Monitor trade submissions for completion and execution rate.”

- **Fulfillment Step**
  - Emphasize: completion, delivery, confirmation, downstream handoff.
  - Signals: fulfillment rate, delivery status, closure confirmation.
  - Alerts: stuck queues, missing handoffs, incomplete chains.
  - Example phrase: “Confirm that downstream systems have received and acknowledged delivery.”

Each signal in the table below reflects a different layer of observability:

- **🟦 Business Signals** reflect value delivery and desired business outcomes.
- **🟨 Process Signals** reflect correct execution of system or business logic.
- **🟧 System Signals** reflect the infrastructure, platform, or service health needed to support the step.
