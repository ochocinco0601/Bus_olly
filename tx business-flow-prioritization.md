# Business Flow Prioritization Template

## Purpose
This template helps identify the next 1-3 critical business flows for BOS Factory implementation following our successful Capital Markets pilot.

## Selection Criteria
We recommend prioritizing business flows that meet these criteria:

1. **Business Impact**: Flows with direct customer or financial impact
2. **Incident Frequency**: Areas experiencing frequent monitoring-related incidents
3. **Complexity**: Processes crossing multiple systems or teams
4. **Observability Gaps**: Existing dashboards lack business context or ownership
5. **Leadership Visibility**: Processes regularly reviewed in Start of Day meetings

## Currently Under Consideration

| Business Flow | Description | Business Owner | Technical SME | Current Observability Status |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| Loan Origination | End-to-end mortgage application process | J. Thompson | A. Rodriguez | Technical dashboards only, no business signals |
| Payments Processing | Customer payment transaction lifecycle | M. Johnson | S. Patel | Fragmented monitoring across multiple systems |
| Trade Settlement | Post-trade clearing and settlement process | R. Williams | T. Chen | Partial implementation (Capital Markets pilot) |
| Fraud Detection | Real-time transaction monitoring | K. Lee | D. Miller | Alert-heavy with little business context |
| Customer Onboarding | New account creation and verification | P. Garcia | E. Smith | Minimal monitoring, mostly manual checks |

## What We Need From You Today

3. **Owner Assignment**: Named owners for each role in selected flows
4. **Timeline Alignment**: Confirmation that work can begin in Q3 2025

## Implementation Process Overview
Once flows are selected, we'll follow this process:

1. **Kickoff**: Workshop with all three roles to align on business flow steps
