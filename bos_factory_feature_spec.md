## Feature Specification: BOS Factory Template Lifecycle Engine

### 1. **Feature Title**
BOS Factory Template Lifecycle Engine

### 2. **Executive Summary**
The BOS Factory Template Lifecycle Engine is a structured system that transforms a business step into a fully observable, traceable, and reusable unit of operational knowledge. It empowers Product, Development, and SRE teams to co-create observability artifacts around business-relevant workflows. The lifecycle engine automates and orchestrates the generation of observability templates, signals, ownership metadata, and dashboard panels using a modular process.

### 3. **Problem Statement**
Observability efforts across the enterprise are fragmented, with no shared lifecycle for defining, validating, and operationalizing observability at the business process step level. Without a unified system, teams create dashboards inconsistently, duplicate work, and fail to trace technical signals back to business outcomes.

### 4. **Goals and Success Metrics**
- Enable structured creation and validation of business observability steps
- Decrease time to complete a signal-enriched template by 50%
- Increase signal-to-owner traceability to 100% for every published step
- Ensure 90% of dashboard panels are generated from validated templates

### 5. **Scope (In/Out)**
**In Scope:**
- Step flow definition
- Template generation
- Signal enrichment (business, process, system)
- Ownership metadata capture
- Reference card and dashboard panel generation

**Out of Scope:**
- Full dashboard assembly (multi-panel aggregation)
- Real-time alerting implementation

### 6. **Solution Overview**
The Template Lifecycle Engine operates as a sequenced factory pipeline. Product Owners initiate the process by framing the step. The system prompts for role-based input, populates observability fields, enriches signal data, and creates structured outputs like reference cards and dashboard panel mockups. It uses GenAI where applicable to reduce effort and ensure standardization.

*Assumption: The BOS UI integrates with GitHub and Confluence for artifact storage.*

### 7. **Feature Breakdown**
- **Visual Flow Tree Renderer**: Generates a navigable visual tree of the business flow, showing all defined steps and their relationships. Supports drill-down into individual step artifacts and helps users trace sequence, dependencies, and ownership visually.
- **Step Initialization**: Flow definition + step ID
- **Template Drafting**: GenAI template generator with placeholder awareness
- **Field Completion**: Role-based guided input for business and technical context
- **Signal Enrichment**: Matrix prompt for three signal types
- **Ownership Traceability**: Embedded assignment table
- **Reference Card Formatter**: Markdown + copy-ready block
- **Dashboard Mockup Generator**: Text-based panel preview output
- **Archive and Reuse**: Final export and versioning system

### 8. **Acceptance Criteria**
- GIVEN a validated business flow with defined steps, WHEN the user opens the visual flow view, THEN the system displays a hierarchical tree of all steps in sequence, with links to their templates and mockups.
- GIVEN a new business step is identified, WHEN the product owner submits a flow definition, THEN the system generates a draft template with populated metadata fields.
- GIVEN a signal enrichment prompt is triggered, WHEN roles supply signal inputs, THEN all signal types (business, process, system) are captured and labeled.
- GIVEN a finalized step template, WHEN the mockup generator runs, THEN the output panel includes purpose, signals, and owner metadata in the expected format.

### 9. **Dependencies and Risks**
**Dependencies:**
- Stable prompt library for template and signal generation
- Reliable UI integration for collaborative editing
- Confluence/GitHub for artifact storage

**Risks:**
- Over-reliance on GenAI may produce hallucinated or misaligned fields
- Lack of role clarity can stall ownership validation
- Dashboard builders may ignore mockups if not properly linked

### 10. **Test Scenarios**
- Render a flow tree for a business process with 3+ steps and verify clickable access to each stepâ€™s template and dashboard mockup.
- Validate display accuracy when a new step is added to an existing flow.
- Confirm that unlinked or incomplete steps are flagged visually.
- Validate signal ownership trace from mini card to signal map
- Test generation of dashboard panel mockups for multiple step types
- Simulate role handoffs from Product Owner to Dev and SRE
- Trigger error paths for incomplete signal enrichment

### 11. **Rollout Plan**
- **Phase 1:** Use with Capital Markets pilot flow (3 steps)
- **Phase 2:** Enable for 2 more ARTs with end-to-end flows
- **Phase 3:** Publish UI prompt integration and archival workflow
- **Phase 4:** Link panel mockups to live dashboards in Splunk/Grafana

### 12. **Sustainability and Monitoring**
- Track percentage of reused templates vs net new
- Monitor template completion time by step type
- Alert on missing signal ownership in final output
- Periodically review archived steps for business relevance
