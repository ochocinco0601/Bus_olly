**Introducing Our Handbook-Driven Approach**

Team,

To improve clarity and consistency across our documentation, we're adopting a "GitLab Handbook" style approach. The goal is straightforward:

- **Document often**: Add information to pages proactively.  
- **Draft is the default**: It's perfectly fine for documentation to be incomplete or evolving. Information will always be changing—that's expected and encouraged.
- **Collaborate openly**: Updates, suggestions, and incremental improvements are welcome.

Let's build a habit of frequently updating our pages—even partial or incomplete updates provide value. Documentation is always a work-in-progress, and getting started is better than waiting for perfection.

Your contributions are greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Here are some visual suggestions to enhance your Confluence page and emphasize your message clearly:

### 1. **Progress Loop or Cycle Diagram**
- **Purpose:** Visually communicates the iterative and evolving nature of documentation.
- **Suggested Elements:**  
  - "Draft" → "Collaborate" → "Revise" → "Improve"
  - Circular arrows to emphasize ongoing iteration.

### 2. **Simple Iconography**
- **Purpose:** Quickly reinforces key points with minimal cognitive load.
- **Suggested Icons:**  
  - 📝 Pencil or notebook for **"Document often"**  
  - 🔄 Circular arrows for **"Draft is the default"**  
  - 🤝 People or chat bubbles for **"Collaborate openly"**

### 3. **Banner or Callout Box**
- **Purpose:** Highlights the core philosophy visually on the top of your page.
- **Example Callout:**  
  > 🚧 **Draft is Good!**
  >
  > Documentation is always evolving—add info early and often. No need to wait for perfection.

### 4. **Animated GIF (Optional)**
- **Purpose:** Adds friendly tone, humor, and encourages the action of "getting started."
- **Suggested Theme:**  
  - Someone quickly sketching or typing notes  
  - Lighthearted "work-in-progress" animations (construction sign, gears moving)

### 5. **Visual Checklist**
- **Purpose:** Makes core expectations actionable and scannable.
- **Example:**
  - ☑️ Add notes, even if incomplete  
  - ☑️ Share drafts openly  
  - ☑️ Revise regularly as new information emerges
