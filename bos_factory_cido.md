## CIDO Problem Statement: Business Observability System Factory

### **Context**
In large enterprise technology organizations, monitoring and observability are fragmented across toolsets, teams, and roles. Business units rely on hundreds of applications and processes, but there is no unified system that traces technical performance to business outcomes. Most teams operate in silos, using ad hoc dashboards and alerts that lack clear ownership, business context, or relevance to user goals.

### **Issue**
There is no shared system of record that connects business process steps, performance signals, and responsible roles. As a result, observability efforts are inconsistent, unscalable, and often fail to answer critical questions like “What’s the business impact?” during incident response or system health reviews. Ownership is unclear, and teams spend more time building one-off dashboards than aligning on shared observability models.

### **Downside**
- Incidents take longer to resolve due to unclear business context.
- Critical issues are missed or misprioritized due to weak signal-to-outcome mapping.
- Dashboards become orphaned or misused without traceability or responsibility.
- Business stakeholders lack confidence in platform health metrics.
- Repeated inefficiencies in onboarding, signal design, and template reuse drain resources.

### **Opportunity**
The BOS Factory enables a modular, scalable framework for business observability that embeds ownership, relevance, and responsibility at every step. It allows teams to align technical signals with business outcomes, produce reusable observability templates, and accelerate dashboard creation with traceable artifacts. This improves time-to-value for monitoring, enhances incident response, and supports leadership’s need for visibility into system impact on business goals.
