# BOS Factory Presentation - Speaking Notes

| Slide | Speaking Notes | Est. Time |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **1. Title Slide: BOS Factory: From Problem to Solution** | * Good morning everyone. Today, we're talking about the BOS Factory and how it provides real solutions to problems we face every day in managing our critical business processes.<br>* I'm excited to share what we've built and how it can transform our business observability approach.<br>* This is about connecting what we monitor to what actually matters for our business. | 45 seconds |
| **2. The Problem: Incident Response Today** | * Let's start with a real problem we've all experienced. Think back to when the FICC Gateway went down at 6:08 AM.<br>* The Platform team got alerts about system availability, but nobody knew the business impact for 45+ minutes.<br>* There was no clear ownership of who needed to act.<br>* Multiple teams scrambled, trying to piece together meaning while our business stakeholders kept asking, "What does this mean for us?"<br>* This highlights our critical issue: fragmented observability disconnected from business impact, often with unclear ownership.<br>* It's not just a technology problem; it's a shared responsibility problem.<br>* Our dashboards don't keep up when business changes, we can't tie system alerts to business impact, and we lack a scalable, consistent process. | 2 minutes |
| **3. The Solution: The BOS Factory** | * Our solution is the BOS Factory.<br>* Its purpose is to systematically build business observability that connects daily technical work to business outcomes by embedding ownership, relevance, and responsibility at every layer.<br>* The Factory creates structured artifacts with clear ownership that connect system alerts directly to business outcomes.<br>* The fundamental success factor is a shared ownership model. This is a three-way partnership, not just Platform's job.<br>* Product Teams define what business metrics matter and set thresholds for "good" vs "bad." They know which outcomes matter to customers.<br>* Application Teams explain how the business logic flows and identify key process checkpoints. They know how the application processes work.<br>* Platform Teams build the monitoring infrastructure and implement dashboards and alerts. They provide the foundation but need input from the other teams. | 2 minutes |
| **4. How the Factory Works** | * The Factory works through a repeatable process, which we've proven with our Capital Markets team.<br>* First, Product defines what matters to the business.<br>* Then, App Dev explains how the application processes work.<br>* Next, Platform builds how we'll monitor it.<br>* Finally, all three sign off, agreeing on their responsibilities.<br>* This structured approach involves phases: Define, Populate, Validate, Build, and Monitor, converting your business priorities into requirements and outputs. | 1.5 minutes |
| **5. Real Factory Artifacts** | * We've already built real artifacts with Jake's team in Capital Markets.<br>* The Mini-Reference Card is a one-page summary for a business step, showing why it matters, who owns each signal, and what to do when something breaks.<br>* For "Step 1.1: Receive Pooling Data from System B," it clearly states that ensuring accurate and timely ingestion is critical for compliant trade creation and reducing operational risk.<br>* It lists signals categorized by BUSINESS (like percent of pool files ingested within SLA), PROCESS (like validation pass rate), and SYSTEM (like ingestion job latency).<br>* Crucially, each signal has a defined owner: Product Owner, Application Developer, or Platform SRE.<br>* It includes a Responsibility Table mapping conditions to actions and responsible roles.<br>* The Dashboard Panel is a visual display showing the health of the step with the same layered signals and owners.<br>* We also have artifacts like the Persona Role Guide, Tactical Checklist, and BO Template. | 3 minutes |
| **6. The Same Incident With BOS Factory** | * Let's revisit that FICC Gateway incident, but imagine it happening with these BOS Factory artifacts in place.<br>* There would be immediate business context: Trade creation is impacted.<br>* There would be clear ownership: Each signal is tied to a specific role.<br>* There's an Action table with predefined responses based on the condition.<br>* Business impact is visible via the SLA compliance status – a Product-owned metric.<br>* Process verification is visible via validation pass rates – an App Dev-owned metric.<br>* And System status is visible via gateway response times – a Platform-owned metric.<br>* This transforms observability from a reactive technical exercise to a proactive business capability. | 1.5 minutes |
| **7. Implementation Timeline** | * We've proven this works and are ready to scale. Here's our proposed timeline:<br>* Next 2 weeks: Complete the initial Capital Markets implementation. This is currently in progress.<br>* Q3 2025: Apply to the next 1-3 critical business flows. This needs your input and decision.<br>* Q4 2025: Expand to 2-3 additional flows. This needs resource commitment and planning.<br>* Q4 2025: Integrate with Start of Day reviews. This is in the planning phase.<br>* 2026: Scale across the enterprise.<br>* Critical success factors include executive commitment to the three-role model, resource allocation during PI Planning, and integration with Start of Day reviews.<br>* It requires a culture shift from "Platform does monitoring" to shared accountability. | 2 minutes |
| **8. What We Need From You** | * We've built the Factory, tested the approach, and have the templates and guides. The Factory is ready to take your inputs.<br>* What we need from you today, the key questions, are:<br>* Which critical business flow matters most to you right now? We need your definition of what's important.<br>* Will you commit resources from all three teams? This requires dedicated capacity.<br>* Will you help establish this as a shared responsibility? We need commitment to enforce shared ownership.<br>* Committing to these steps will lead to expected business outcomes like MTTR reduction, complete ownership accountability, clear business impact visibility in Start of Day reviews, and a scalable framework for our applications.<br>* Thank you. We're ready to start building business observability together. | 1.5 minutes |
