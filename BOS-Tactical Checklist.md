## Tactical Checklist: Implementing Business Observability

### 1. Start Here: Use This Checklist

> Use this checklist as your starting point for implementing business observability. It is more than just a checklist—it's a system. A solution. A repeatable framework that guides teams through a unified approach to observability that connects business operations, performance signals, and technical accountability. By following this structured path, teams ensure consistent practices, traceable ownership, and measurable business value across every observability effort.

| # | Task                     | Description                                                                  | Output                               | Supporting Artifact     | Responsible Role(s)                |

| 3 | Identify a pilot process | Choose an initial business process or capability to apply this checklist to  | Candidate use case or business flow  | —                       | Product Owner / Business SME       |

### 2. Define Business Flow Structure

| # | Task                        | Description                                         | Output                                 | Supporting Artifact | Responsible Role(s)             |
|---|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 | Define the business process | Identify a business capability or domain to observe | Named process (e.g., Loan Fulfillment) | —                   | Product Owner / Business SME    |
| 2 | Identify stages and steps   | Break the process into Flow → Stages → Steps        | Step hierarchy map                     | —                   | Product Owner / Business SME    |
| 3 | Validate with SMEs          | Confirm accuracy with product and operational leads | Reviewed business flow                 | —                   | Observability Facilitator       |

### 3. Populate the Observability Template

| # | Task                      | Description                                            | Output                             | Supporting Artifact                                   | Responsible Role(s)                        |
|---|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Use GenAI template prompt | Generate a draft observability template for a step     | Pre-filled template                | - Prompt: Template Completion<br>- Form-Style Template | Product Owner                              |
| 2 | Fill in or refine fields  | Collaborate with Product, Dev, SRE to complete context | Completed template                 | - Template Field Cheatsheet<br>- Persona Role Guides   | Product Owner, App Developer, Platform SRE |
| 3 | Validate ownership fields | Confirm each field has a defined accountable role      | Ready for matrix and signal design | - Template Validation Checklist                       | Observability Facilitator                   |
| 4 | Use `Prompt: Business Observability Template Validation` | Apply the prompt matrix to suggest missing values for any incomplete fields | Drafted or placeholder field values | Prompt Matrix | Product Owner, App Developer |

> ✅ Once the observability template is complete and validated, continue to **Step 4.1** and apply the `Prompt: Generate Signal Matrix Row`.  
> This will enrich the template with structured `Business Signal`, `Process Signal`, and `System Signal` definitions, each with assigned ownership.

### 4. Enrich Template with Signal Definitions

> This step transforms a fully validated observability template into a complete, actionable artifact by embedding Business, Process, and System signals directly into the template. Signals are classified and assigned ownership using the Persona Role Guide. The updated template becomes the authoritative source for dashboards, alerts, and traceability.

| # | Task | Description | Output | Supporting Artifact | Responsible Role(s) |
|---|------|-------------|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Enrich template with observability signals | Use the prompt to identify Business, Process, and System signals based on the validated template context | Signals embedded in the template fields: Business Signals, Process Signal, System Signal | `BOS-prompt for BO template signals.md` | Observability Facilitator, App Developer |
| 2 | Assign owners to each signal | For each signal, apply ownership using the Persona Role Guide | Ownership metadata embedded in template alongside signals | Persona Role Guide | Observability Facilitator, Product Owner |
| 3 | Confirm signal coverage and readiness | Validate that all signal types are represented, clearly named, and linked to the template’s business goals or technical function | Fully enriched template ready for dashboard mockups, alerting design, and traceability mapping | Template Validation Checklist | Observability Facilitator |
