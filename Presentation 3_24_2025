# Business Observability: Bridging Technology and Business Value

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title: Bridging the Gap: Business Observability for Enhanced Value**
* Presenter: [SRE Manager's Name]
* [Date of Offsite]

**Speaker Notes:**
"[Senior Leader] asked me to explore connecting our technical metrics to business outcomes. Business observability gives us this capability—evolutionary in implementation but revolutionary in impact. Let's discuss how we can get started."

## Slide 2: What is Business Observability?

**Headline: Evolution in Approach, Revolution in Impact**

**Key Points:**
* A structured approach to understanding how technical performance affects business outcomes
* Maps business processes to their supporting technical components
* Combines business KPIs and technical metrics in a unified view
* Reveals direct relationships between system health and business success
* Answers the question: "How do our systems impact our business goals?"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Business observability connects our technical systems to business processes. It organizes monitoring around business workflows rather than technical architecture. We build on existing tools but gain transformative insights into how our systems impact business results."

## Slide 3: Key Components of Business Observability

**Headline: Building the Business-Technical Bridge**

**Key Components:**
* Business Process Mapping - Documenting critical workflows and customer journeys
* Technical Component Correlation - Connecting each business step to supporting systems
* Integrated Metrics - Combining business KPIs with technical performance indicators
* Business-Oriented Visualization - Organizing dashboards around processes, not services
* Impact Assessment - Quickly determining business consequences of technical issues

**Speaker Notes:**
"Five key components make this work: mapping business processes, correlating them to technical components, integrating business and technical metrics, visualizing by process rather than service, and enabling rapid business impact assessment during incidents."

## Slide 4: Example: Loan Origination Process

**Headline: Business Observability in Action**

**Diagram:**
```
└── 🎯 Business Outcome: Increased Successful Loan Origination  
    └── 📋 Stage: Application Review & Communication  
        [Outcome: Clear decision-making & defined next steps]  
        └── ⚙️ Step: Review Application & Communicate Decision  
            → 📊 Signals:  
                ├─ Business Signals:  
                │   • Review Turnaround Time (Target: <2 business days)
                │   • Customer Notification Rate (Target: 100%)
                │   • Approval Rate (Benchmark: 62%)
                └─ Technical Reliability Signals:  
                    • Communication System Availability (Target: 99.9%)
                    • Review Processing Time (Target: <3 minutes)
                    • Error Rate in Decision Logic (Target: <0.1%)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's the loan origination example. Business goal: increase successful originations. We map this to stages, steps, and finally to specific business and technical metrics. Now we can directly see how technical issues impact business outcomes."

## Slide 5: Benefits of Business Observability

**Headline: Evolutionary Approach, Revolutionary Results**

**Key Benefits:**
* Aligns engineering priorities with business objectives
* Reduces mean time to identify and resolve business-impacting issues
* Provides quantifiable business context for technical decisions
* Improves cross-functional collaboration and shared understanding
* Enables data-driven investment decisions in technology
* Transforms perception of IT from cost center to value creator

**Speaker Notes:**
"Key benefits: We win prioritization battles by showing business impact. We speed up incident response by immediately seeing business consequences. We improve collaboration with product teams through shared context. We make smarter investment decisions based on business value."

## Slide 6: Our Implementation Timeline

**Headline: Roadmap to Business Observability**

**Implementation Timeline:**
* **Weeks 1-2:** Identify and map loan origination process with business partners
* **Weeks 3-4:** Define critical business KPIs and map to existing technical metrics
* **Weeks 5-8:** Develop initial visualization dashboards using existing tools
* **Weeks 9-12:** Pilot with loan origination process, gather feedback, and refine
* **Beyond:** Evaluate results and expand to additional business processes

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our timeline: Two weeks to map the loan process, two weeks to define metrics, four weeks to build dashboards using existing tools, four weeks to pilot and refine. We'll leverage what we have—no need for new infrastructure."

## Slide 7: Getting Started - Practical Approach

**Headline: How to Begin Your Business Observability Journey**

**Practical Steps:**
* **Start Small:** Select one critical business process (e.g., loan origination)
* **Map the Process:** Document stages, steps, and desired outcomes
* **Identify Metrics:** Define both business KPIs and technical indicators
* **Connect the Dots:** Link technical components to each process step
* **Visualize:** Build simple dashboards organized by business process
* **Collaborate:** Engage both technical and business stakeholders
* **Learn & Expand:** Refine your approach before adding more processes

**Speaker Notes:**
"To get started: Pick one critical process. Map it thoroughly. Identify the right metrics. Connect technical components to each step. Build process-oriented dashboards. Collaborate with business teams. Learn from our first implementation before expanding."

## Slide 8: Q&A and Discussion

**Headline: Questions & Discussion**

**Prompts for Discussion:**
* What business processes would benefit most from this approach?
* What technical metrics are we currently missing?
* How can we effectively involve business stakeholders?

**Speaker Notes:**
"What questions do you have? I'm particularly interested in which processes we should prioritize and how we can best engage with our business partners on this initiative."
