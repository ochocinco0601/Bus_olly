# Dashboard Overview

Welcome to the **Incident Notification Monitoring Dashboard**. This dashboard provides insights into the incident notification trends, specifically focusing on incidents created over time and the use of **email** as a notification action.

## Key Metrics
- **Total Incidents**: The count of all incidents created in BigPanda over time.
- **Incidents with Email Notifications**: The count of incidents where email is included as a notification action.
- **Email Notification Rate**: The percentage of incidents that include email notifications.

## Purpose
This dashboard is designed to help the team monitor compliance with the directive to reduce email notifications for incident alerts. Our goal is to have **99% of incidents** routed through BigPanda without triggering email notifications.

## Definitions
- **Incident**: An event triggered in BigPanda that represents a detected issue or failure.
- **Email Notification Action**: A notification action that sends an email to designated recipients. This is being phased out in favor of more effective communication methods like **SMS**, **Slack**, and **phone alerts**.

## Goals
- Track the **total number of incidents** created over time.
- Monitor the **percentage of incidents** that include email as a notification action.
- Visualize trends showing a **decline in email notifications** with a target of reaching less than 1% over time.

## Interactivity Tips
- **Hover over chart elements**: Hover over any graph or data point to view more detailed information, such as exact values.
- **Filter by Team**: Use the **Team** dropdown at the top to filter incidents by specific teams or applications. This will dynamically update the dashboard to focus on your selected team or application.
