h2. The Business Observability Reference Model

h3. Introduction to the Reference Model

{panel:title=Overview|borderColor=#D4E5F9|titleBGColor=#D4E5F9|bgColor=#EFF5FF}
The Business Observability Reference Model provides a structured framework for connecting business outcomes to the underlying technical components that support them. This hierarchical model helps organizations visualize and understand how technical performance impacts business results, enabling more effective monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimization.

By implementing this model, organizations can bridge the gap between technical metrics and business value, creating a common language for business and technical stakeholders to discuss system health and performance.
{panel}

h3. The Hierarchical Framework

{panel:title=Framework Structure|borderColor=#D4E5F9|titleBGColor=#D4E5F9|bgColor=#EFF5FF}
The Business Observability Reference Model consists of six distinct layers, organized in a top-down hierarchy:

1. **Business Outcomes**
2. **Business Processes / Customer Journeys**
3. **Stages**
4. **Steps**
5. **Signals**
6. **Observability Data**
{panel}

Let's explore each of these layers in detail:

h4. 1. Business Outcomes

{panel:title=Definition|borderColor=#D4E5F9|titleBGColor=#D4E5F9|bgColor=#EFF5FF}
**Business Outcomes**: High-level strategic goals or measurable impacts the organization seeks to achieve.
{panel}

**Examples**:
- Increase successful mortgage application completions
- Improve customer retention rates
- Reduce operational costs
- Ensure regulatory compliance and risk mitigation

{panel:borderColor=#E9E9E9|bgColor=#F5F5F5}
Business outcomes represent what success looks like for the organization. They are typically aligned with strategic objectives and often have direct financial implications. They provide the "why" for observability efforts, ensuring that technical monitoring supports what matters most to the business.
{panel}

h4. 2. Business Processes / Customer Journeys

{panel:title=Definition|borderColor=#D4E5F9|titleBGColor=#D4E5F9|bgColor=#EFF5FF}
**Business Processes / Customer Journeys**: Specific workflows, interactions, or user activities that directly support or lead to achieving the stated business outcomes.
{panel}

**Examples**:
- Mortgage loan origination process
- Online account management
- Automated backend processing
- Regulatory data reporting

{panel:borderColor=#E9E9E9|bgColor=#F5F5F5}
Business processes represent the practical activities that customers or internal users perform to achieve the desired outcomes. They form the backbone of the observability model, serving as the bridge between business goals and technical implementation.
{panel}

h4. 3. Stages

{panel:title=Definition|borderColor=#D4E5F9|titleBGColor=#D4E5F9|bgColor=#EFF5FF}
**Stages**: Logical segments within a business process representing key phases or milestones.
{panel}

**Examples**:
- For mortgage origination: Application submission, Application validation
- For account management: Account access, Transaction management
- For data processing: Data pipeline processing

{panel:borderColor=#E9E9E9|bgColor=#F5F5F5}
Stages break down complex business processes into manageable segments, making it easier to understand where in the process issues might occur. They provide a more granular view while still maintaining a business-oriented perspective.
{panel}

h4. 4. Steps

{panel:title=Definition|borderColor=#D4E5F9|titleBGColor=#D4E5F9|bgColor=#EFF5FF}
**Steps**: Individual tasks or specific user/system actions within each stage.
{panel}

**Examples**:
- Complete application form
- Customer login
- Payment processing
- Data transformation and loading

{panel:borderColor=#E9E9E9|bgColor=#F5F5F5}
Steps represent the specific activities that must be completed to progress through a stage. They are discrete enough to map directly to technical components while still being meaningful from a business perspective.
{panel}

h4. 5. Signals

{panel:title=Definition|borderColor=#D4E5F9|titleBGColor=#D4E5F9|bgColor=#EFF5FF}
**Signals**: Clearly defined metrics representing health, reliability, or performance of a step.
{panel}

**Examples**:
- Login success rate
- Payment transaction latency
- Batch job completion rate
- Pipeline error rate

{panel:borderColor=#E9E9E9|bgColor=#F5F5F5}
Signals are the quantifiable indicators that measure the performance and health of each step. They serve as the key connection points between business processes and technical monitoring, providing visibility into how well the technical components are supporting business functions.
{panel}

h4. 6. Observability Data

{panel:title=Definition|borderColor=#D4E5F9|titleBGColor=#D4E5F9|bgColor=#EFF5FF}
**Observability Data**: Raw data collected from systems providing deeper context and diagnostic capability.
{panel}

**Examples**:
- API response times
- HTTP error rates
- Database query performance
- Log entries

{panel:borderColor=#E9E9E9|bgColor=#F5F5F5}
Observability data represents the underlying technical telemetry that provides detailed information about system behavior. This data supports the signals and enables deeper investigation when issues arise.
{panel}

h3. Visualizing the Model

{panel:title=Hierarchical Structure|borderColor=#DEEAF0|titleBGColor=#DEEAF0|bgColor=#F7FAFB}
```
Business Outcome
└── Business Process / Customer Journey
    └── Stage (Logical segment)
        └── Step (Individual task or action)
            └── Signal (Metrics for Steps)
                └── Observability Data
```
{panel}

h3. Example: Mortgage Application Process

{panel:title=Real-World Example|borderColor=#D5E9D5|titleBGColor=#D5E9D5|bgColor=#F1F8F1}
To illustrate the Business Observability Reference Model in action, let's apply it to a mortgage application process:

{code:title=Mortgage Application Process Example}
Business Outcome: Increased Successful Mortgage Application Completions
└── Business Process: Mortgage Loan Origination
    └── Stage: Application Submission
        └── Step: Complete Application Form
            └── Signals:
                ├── Application form load time (Target: <2 seconds)
                └── Submission success rate (Target: >98%)
                    └── Observability Data:
                        ├── API response times
                        └── Form validation error logs
    └── Stage: Application Validation
        └── Step: Application Validation
            └── Signals:
                ├── Validation transaction latency (Target: <3 seconds)
                └── Validation error rate (Target: <1%)
                    └── Observability Data:
                        ├── Microservice latency metrics
                        └── Validation service error counts
{code}

This example demonstrates how the model connects a high-level business outcome (increased successful mortgage applications) to the specific technical components and metrics that support it.
