| **Transition 1→2** |  | • Introduction to BOS • Setting up the problem-solution approach | • Thank you for joining me today to discuss the Business Observability System, or BOS. • Let's look at where we are today and how the BOS Factory approach transforms that reality. |
| 2 | From Fragmentation to Factory: The BOS Approach | • Explain fragmented observability problem • Introduce 3D printer metaphor • Explain layered approach for complete visibility • Emphasize ownership and business relevance | • We all know the challenge today: Observability is fragmented. Technical signals exist but rarely tell the full business story. When incidents happen, too much time is spent piecing together meaning rather than solving the problem. • The BOS Factory solves this by working like a 3D printer for business observability. We start with structured templates as our digital blueprints. Then, layer by layer, we build complete visibility: system signals form the foundation, process signals add operational context, and business signals complete the picture. • Each component has clear ownership and direct ties to business outcomes, making our observability sustainable, scalable, and operationally reliable. |
| **Transition 2→3** |  | • Bridge from approach to foundation • Set up discussion of principles | • Now that you understand the BOS Factory approach, let's explore what makes this system truly effective. • For BOS to succeed, it needs core principles beyond just technical implementation. |
| 3 | Core Belief — The Foundation of BOS | • Explain core belief differentiating BOS • Ownership, relevance, responsibility as foundation • Connect to business outcomes • Highlight importance of foundation | • At the heart of the BOS Factory is a core belief that differentiates it from traditional monitoring approaches. • We believe that any observability system will only deliver lasting value if ownership, relevance, and responsibility are embedded at every step. • This isn't just about building better dashboards. It's about creating a system that teaches teams how their work connects to business outcomes. • Without this foundation, we'll continue building fragmented or abandoned dashboards that fail to serve their purpose. |
| **Transition 3→4** |  | • Connect principles to process • Set up 5-step explanation | • With this foundation of ownership and responsibility, let's see how the BOS Factory actually works. • It operates through a structured 5-step process, building observability layer by layer. |
| 4 | The BOS Factory: A 5-Step Process | • Explain 5-step process using 3D printer comparison • Walk through each step and its purpose • Show how layers build upon each other • Connect to business value | • The BOS Factory operates through a structured, repeatable 5-step process — just like a 3D printer building layer by layer. • First, we \*\*define\*\* the business flows: Mapping key steps, users, and business outcomes. • Then we \*\*populate\*\* the observability templates: Capturing KPIs, business signals, process signals, and system signals. • Next, we \*\*validate\*\* ownership: Ensuring every signal and every step has a clear accountable owner across Product, Development, and Platform teams. • After validation, we \*\*build\*\* dashboard requirements: Structuring what needs to be visualized — tied to business outcomes and operational reliability. • Finally, we \*\*monitor and improve\*\*: Embedding feedback loops that allow the system to evolve as business needs and technical environments change. • Every step adds a new layer — system, process, and business signals — reinforcing structure and traceability. • The result is a complete, implementation-ready set of requirements that connect technical work directly to business value. |
| **Transition 4→5** |  | • Emphasize ownership's importance • Set up roles and responsibilities | • This 5-step process depends entirely on clear ownership across all teams. • Let's look at how responsibilities are distributed for sustainable success. |
| 5 | Shared Ownership Model — The Foundation of BOS Success | • Explain this is not just Platform responsibility • Detail roles of Product Owners, App Developers, Platform Teams • Use 3D printer analogy for multiple inputs • Emphasize partnership across teams | • This is not just a Platform team responsibility. • For BOS to succeed, we need clear ownership across all three areas: Product Owners, Application Developers, Platform Teams. • Product Owners define the business signals and KPIs that matter. They establish what success looks like from a business perspective. • Application Developers provide the process signals and technical context. They help ensure we have the right visibility into system behavior and business logic execution. • Platform Teams implement the monitoring infrastructure and dashboard capabilities. They deliver the system-level telemetry and observability backbone. • Like a 3D printer that requires multiple material inputs to create a complete object, our BOS Factory needs all three groups working in partnership. • Only when all three converge — Product, Development, and Platform — do we get a complete, sustainable business observability system. |
| **Transition 5→6** |  | • Connect ownership to artifacts • Introduce living documents concept | • Shared ownership requires durable artifacts that teams can rely on every day. • These aren't static documents—they're living systems of record used actively across our operations. |
| 6 | Systems of Record Concept | • Explain outputs as systems of record • Describe living contracts between teams • Show how artifacts are used in incidents, reviews • Emphasize consistency and accuracy over time | • What makes the BOS Factory truly powerful is that its outputs become the definitive systems of record for business observability. • These aren't static documents that sit unused in SharePoint or file shares. • They are living contracts between Product, Development, and Platform teams: clearly defining what matters, who owns it, and how it connects to business outcomes. • During incidents, teams reference these artifacts immediately: to understand the business impact, to guide faster, more accurate responses. • In Start of Day review meeting they provide clear business context and show where we stand at a glance. • Because they're factory-produced with consistent structure and ownership, they stay accurate, auditable, and relevant, even as our systems and teams evolve over time. |
| **Transition 6→7** |  | • Transition to real-world example • Set up Capital Markets case | • Let me show you how this works in practice with our Capital Markets pilot. • We've already moved from concept to implementation with real business processes. |
| 7 | BOS Factory in Action: Capital Markets Example | • Introduce Capital Markets example • Explain three-layer approach with ownership • Use 3D printing metaphor • Highlight implementation-readiness | **Introduction and context:** • Let me show you a concrete example from our work with Jake's team on the Capital Markets flow. • This isn't just theoretical \- we've already generated structured requirements with clear ownership boundaries through our BOS Factory process. \*\*Three-layer approach with ownership:\*\* • First, Business signals owned by Product Owners that directly connect to business outcomes. • Second, Process signals owned by Application Developers ensuring data processing integrity. • Third, System signals owned by Platform SREs monitoring technical health. \*\*3D printing metaphor and value:\*\* • What you're seeing is like a completed 3D print \- layer by layer, we've built a complete view of business observability with clear accountability at each level. • These requirements are implementation-ready and establish the ownership and business context we've never had consistently before. |
| **Transition 7→8** |  | • Transition from proof to scaling • Set up implementation approach | • We've proven this works. Now, let's discuss scaling across the enterprise. • We're taking a phased, deliberate approach to expand beyond our pilot. |
| 8 | Implementation Approach: From Factory to Production | • Outline deliberate phased approach • Explain each phase and its focus • Use 3D printing scaling analogy • Emphasize respect for team commitments | • We'll take a deliberate approach to scaling BOS across the enterprise. • We'll start by completing the Capital Markets pilot: Demonstrating the full end-to-end process — from factory requirements to implemented dashboard. • In Phase 2, we'll expand to three critical flows: Using early lessons to refine the BOS process, Making it even more repeatable and efficient. • By Phase 3, we'll integrate with the Start of Day review process: Embedding business observability directly into daily operational routines. • And by Phase 4, we'll move to full enterprise deployment: Scaling across ARTs and platforms, With standardized patterns for signals, ownership, and dashboards. • Throughout this journey, we'll move from custom, artisanal production — to standardized, industrial-scale operation. • Just like how 3D printing evolved: From building one prototype at a time, To full production lines creating high-quality, repeatable outputs. • This measured approach respects existing team commitments, While delivering increasing business value at every stage. |
| **Transition 8→9** |  | • Transition from approach to requirements • Set up success criteria | • We've outlined our phased, deliberate approach to scaling the BOS Factory. • For this implementation to succeed, we need three critical elements in place. |
| 9 | What We Need to Succeed | • Outline three key requirements • Explain executive commitment • Detail shared accountability • Address resource allocation • Connect to 3D printer requirements analogy | • For BOS to succeed, we need three critical elements in place. • First, Executive Commitment: We need leadership to make BOS a strategic priority, with visibility in Start of Day reviews and validation during PI Planning. • Second, Shared Accountability: Product Owners defining business signals, Developers implementing process signals, Platform Teams enabling system signals. All three groups working together, with clear ownership at every layer. • Third, Resource Allocation: Each team needs dedicated capacity within existing planning structures, to fulfill their role without relying on ad hoc efforts. • Just like a 3D printer requires a stable power source, multiple material inputs, and dedicated operation time to consistently produce quality outputs, our BOS Factory needs these foundational elements to deliver sustainable, business-connected observability at scale. • With these in place, we can move from early wins to a fully integrated, enterprise-wide system — without overwhelming teams or disrupting existing planning rhythms. |
| **Transition 9→10** |  | • Transition to immediate actions • Set up concrete next steps | • With these supports in place, we're ready to move forward immediately. • Here are the concrete next actions we're taking. |
| 10 | Next Steps: Immediate Actions | • Outline immediate concrete actions • Show timeline for Capital Markets completion • Address dashboard implementation • Request inputs for next flows • Emphasize work already underway | • We're ready to move forward immediately with concrete, achievable next steps. • First, over the next two weeks: We will complete the Capital Markets requirements, Finalize the structured BOS artifacts, And validate that the first dashboard panels are operationally ready. • Then, within the next month: We will implement the first production dashboard in HealthScope, Connecting structured signals directly to business outcomes and operational visibility. • Most importantly, today: We need leadership input to select the next two critical business flows To prioritize for BOS onboarding and signal implementation. • This sequence — completing the first dashboard, selecting next flows, and scaling incrementally — ensures we keep delivering immediate business value, while steadily expanding BOS Factory adoption. • Work is already underway. With your partnership, we can accelerate and scale. |
| **Transition 10→11** |  | • Frame BOS as strategic system • Set up closing | • Business Observability isn't just another dashboard initiative. • It's a structured system connecting daily work to outcomes that matter. |
| 11 | Closing | • Present BOS as strategic system • Emphasize structured, sustainable approach • Highlight system and path readiness • Call for partnership • Emphasize transformation opportunity | • Business Observability isn't just another dashboard initiative. • It's a structured, sustainable system that connects the work we do every day to the outcomes we care about most. • Through the BOS Factory approach, we've created a system that embeds ownership, ensures business relevance, and scales naturally across the enterprise. • We have the system: A proven, structured process that produces valuable, traceable outputs. • We have the path: A clear, phased implementation roadmap, starting with the Capital Markets pilot. • With your partnership, we can move forward deliberately, scaling observability with impact and precision. • Together, we have the opportunity to fundamentally transform how we understand and communicate the business impact of our technology. • Thank you. |
