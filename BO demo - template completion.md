| Description of Technical Function | System A receives batch files from System B, parses structured loan pool data, and stores results in internal tables for further processing. |
| Business Function / Purpose       | Ensures Business Unit A has accurate and timely loan pool data to support trade creation, compliance validation, and operational readiness. |
| Customers / Internal Users        | - Business Unit A analysts <br> - Trade operations team <br> - Compliance officers                |
| What Are Users Trying to Accomplish? | - Gain early access to complete and accurate loan pool data <br> - Ensure readiness for trade evaluation and compliance reviews |
| Target Outcomes (KPI)             | - Pool files available in System A within 30 minutes of receipt                                   |
| Definition or Formula (KPI)       | ```(Number of successfully ingested pool files / Number of expected files) Ã— 100```               |
| Business Signals                  | - `Suggested:` *Percent of pool files ingested within SLA* <br> - `Suggested:` *Total loan records processed* <br> `Owner:` Product Owner |
