# BOS Factory: GenAI Framework Input Documents

## **1. Product Context Template**

**Product/System**: BOS Factory  
**Purpose**: A system platform for creating, managing, and visualizing business observability specifications that connect business processes to technical monitoring signals  
**Primary Users**: Product Owners, Development teams, Platform SREs  
**Key Value Proposition**: Bridges the gap between business outcomes and technical observability through structured templates and automated governance  
**Current Stage**: MVP design and conceptualization

## **2. System Domain Definitions**

### **Domain 1: Business Context Establishment**
- **Purpose**: Define business value and outcomes for observability
- **Ownership**: Product
- **Inputs**: Business requirements/strategy
- **Outputs**: Business Observability Template (business sections) stored in system
- **Actions**: Product uses BOS Factory to create new business process and populate business sections

### **Domain 2: Process Decomposition**
- **Purpose**: Structure business activities into observable stages and steps
- **Ownership**: Product
- **Inputs**: Business process in system
- **Outputs**: Business Observability Template (role mapping sections) updated in system
- **Actions**: Product uses BOS Factory to complete role-to-outcome mapping

### **Domain 3: Signal Design**
- **Purpose**: Define measurable indicators for each business process step
- **Ownership**: Product + Development + Platform SRE
- **Inputs**: Process structure in system
- **Outputs**: Complete Business Observability Template in system
- **Actions**: Each actor uses BOS Factory to define their signal types (Business/Process/System)

### **Domain 4: Technical Mapping**
- **Purpose**: Connect signal definitions to actual systems and data sources
- **Ownership**: Development + Platform SRE
- **Inputs**: Signal definitions in system
- **Outputs**: Validated Business Observability Template in system
- **Actions**: Actors use BOS Factory to complete technical implementation sections

### **Domain 5: Visualization Design**
- **Purpose**: Create dashboard mockups and reference materials for monitoring
- **Ownership**: Platform SRE
- **Inputs**: Complete template in system
- **Outputs**: Dashboard Mockup + Mini Reference Card stored in system
- **Actions**: Platform SRE uses BOS Factory to create dashboard mockups and reference cards

### **Domain 6: Business Flow Visualization**
- **Purpose**: Generate visual representations of business process hierarchy
- **Ownership**: System (automated) + Users (viewing)
- **Inputs**: Complete templates with process hierarchy and signals
- **Outputs**: Interactive tree view (Process → Steps → Signals) with drill-down capability
- **Actions**: BOS Factory auto-generates tree structure visualization of business flows

### **Domain 7: Governance Establishment**
- **Purpose**: Maintain ownership, traceability, and audit trails for all artifacts
- **Ownership**: System (automated)
- **Inputs**: All artifacts in BOS Factory
- **Outputs**: Auto-generated Ownership Traceability Table + Change audit
- **Actions**: BOS Factory automatically generates governance artifacts and audit trails

### **Future Domain: Run-Time Business Health Dashboards**
- **Purpose**: Display real-time operational monitoring of business process health
- **Ownership**: Operations teams, business stakeholders
- **Inputs**: Live signal data from enterprise monitoring platforms
- **Outputs**: Live operational monitoring of business processes with actual KPI values and alert states
- **Actions**: BOS Factory displays real-time business flow health using template definitions

## **3. Persona Definitions**

### **Persona: Product Owner**
- **Primary Responsibilities**: Define business requirements, establish success criteria, manage product roadmap, communicate business value to technical teams
- **Key Concerns**: Business-technology alignment, measurable outcomes, stakeholder communication, process documentation
- **Success Metrics**: Business KPI achievement, cross-functional team alignment, requirement clarity, stakeholder satisfaction
- **Typical Pain Points**: Disconnection between business goals and technical implementation, difficulty communicating business impact to technical teams, lack of systematic approach to requirements documentation

### **Persona: Development Team Member**
- **Primary Responsibilities**: Build and maintain application services, implement monitoring instrumentation, map business requirements to technical solutions
- **Key Concerns**: Code quality, system performance, business impact of technical work, implementation priorities
- **Success Metrics**: Service reliability, deployment success rate, business requirement delivery, technical debt management
- **Typical Pain Points**: Unclear business context for technical work, difficulty prioritizing fixes based on business impact, lack of visibility into how code changes affect business processes

### **Persona: Platform SRE**
- **Primary Responsibilities**: System monitoring, incident response, observability implementation, dashboard creation, alert management
- **Key Concerns**: System reliability, alert quality, business impact communication, monitoring effectiveness
- **Success Metrics**: MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery), false positive alert rates, stakeholder satisfaction during incidents, monitoring coverage
- **Typical Pain Points**: Alert noise and false positives, unclear business impact during incidents, manual dashboard creation processes, difficulty communicating technical issues in business terms

### **Persona: Operations Team Member**
- **Primary Responsibilities**: Monitor business process health, respond to operational issues, coordinate incident response, maintain service levels
- **Key Concerns**: Business process reliability, proactive issue detection, customer impact assessment, escalation procedures
- **Success Metrics**: Business SLA achievement, incident response time, customer satisfaction scores, proactive issue detection rate
- **Typical Pain Points**: Lack of real-time business process visibility, difficulty assessing customer impact during incidents, manual monitoring processes, reactive rather than proactive operations

### **Persona: Business Stakeholder**
- **Primary Responsibilities**: Strategic decision making, technology investment prioritization, business performance monitoring, stakeholder reporting
- **Key Concerns**: ROI on technology investments, business performance visibility, competitive advantage, operational efficiency
- **Success Metrics**: Business KPI achievement, technology ROI, operational cost reduction, competitive positioning

## **Usage Instructions**

To replicate the BOS Factory persona-domain analysis using the GenAI framework:

1. **Copy the Product Context** into Prompt 1
2. **Copy all Domain Definitions** into Prompt 1  
3. **Copy all Persona Definitions** into Prompt 1
4. **Execute Prompt 1** to generate detailed analysis
5. **Copy Prompt 1 output** into Prompt 2 to generate matrix visualization

This should reproduce the same persona use cases, domain mappings, and gap analysis that was manually created for the BOS Factory system.
